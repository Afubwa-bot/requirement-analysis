# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Importance of Reaquirement Analysis
-It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
-Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
-Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
-Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
-Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
